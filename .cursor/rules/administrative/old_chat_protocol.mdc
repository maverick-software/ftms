We are about to roll up this chat and hand it off to a new agent. I need you to do the following:

1) Check the checklists folder and read the latest checklist to get an update on where we are in whatever process we are in.

2) Update any checklists we might be working on.

3) Read the README.md, the project docs and create a brief on the application for the incoming agent.
  a) If there is no README.md in the root folder, create one with your new found knowledge

4) Run a perform a list_dir or other set of commands and get knowledge of the directory structure of the codebase. Update the README.md in the root folder.

5) Review our conversation history during this chat.

6) Create a brief that includes your understanding the project, the purpose and the goal, as well as, the current state of affairs, and our progress in this chat. Anything the agent will need to continue this project without a hiccup.
