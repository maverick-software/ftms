Console Log Management Rules  

1. Initial Console Log Setup  

All console logs must be stored in the directory docs/console/logs/.  
Each console log file must follow the naming format of hour, minute, second, date, and console logs to ensure easy session tracking.  
Console logs must be compiled per session, ensuring each session has a dedicated log file.  

2. Console Log Format and Structure  

All console logs must follow a standardized log entry format including date, time, log level, module or component, and message.  
Log levels must follow a structured hierarchy including debug for detailed diagnostic logs, info for general operational logs, warning for non-critical issues that require attention, error for failures that need immediate resolution, and critical for severe failures affecting system stability.  

3. Change Logs File Structure for Console Logs  

Each console log directory must contain a change logs file.  
The change logs file tracks changes made to files and functions related to the console logging system.  
Entries must follow a structured format including date, time, developer or agent name, and description of changes.  

4. Console Log Expansion as the System Grows  

When new features or processes require additional console log categories, determine if new session structures are necessary.  
If a new logging type is required, create a new subdirectory under /console/logs/.  
Ensure all new console logs follow the existing structured format.  
Update the change logs to document the addition of new log categories and files.  

5. Integration with AI Agent  

The AI agent must monitor the system for new console log sessions and automatically handle log file creation.  
If a new feature or function is detected, the AI should insert appropriate logging statements in the system to capture necessary console output.  
The agent must maintain a record of changes to the console logging system in the console logging change log.  

6. Console Log Maintenance and Cleanup  

Implement log rotation to prevent excessive file growth.  
Console logs older than thirty days must be automatically removed based on system retention policies.  
A maximum of three hundred log files should be stored in the /console/logs/ directory at any given time.  
If the directory exceeds the limit, the oldest files should be deleted first to maintain storage efficiency.
