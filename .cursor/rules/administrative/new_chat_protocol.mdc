New Chat Protocol  

**IMPORTANT: USE CORRECT DATE AND TIME STAMP. GET DATE FROM COMPUTER SYSTEM VIA THE COMMAND SHELL USING echo %DATE% %TIME%** *for AI Agents, it is cmd /c echo %DATE% %TIME%*

### **Phase One - Context Protocol Setup**  

1. Locate and read the checklist template in `\docs\context\checklists\`
2. Before you start, copy the checklist template and create a new one \.docs\context\checklists\[checklist][date].
3. Locate and read the most recent context document in `\docs\context\[most_recent_context_doc]` to understand prior investigations, decisions, and discussions.  
4. Update your checklist as you move through your priorities.

### **Phase Two - Detailed System Analysis**  

1. Read the `README.md` file to gain a high-level understanding of the project’s purpose, architecture, and key components. 
2. Read `\docs\plans\[checklists]` to understand what we have been working on and where we are at in our plan.
3. Identify and analyze **core files** that define the system’s key operations, dependencies, and interactions with external systems.  
4. Examine the **database schema** and **data relationships** to understand how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated. This includes reviewing database models, migration files, and any SQL queries used within the project.  
5. Check for **API endpoints**, and **Entry Points** if applicable, to determine how the system communicates with external services or clients.  

### **Phase Three - Problem Identification and Next Steps**  

**IMPORTANT: USE CORRECT DATE AND TIME STAMP. GET DATE FROM COMPUTER SYSTEM VIA THE COMMAND SHELL USING `echo %DATE% %TIME%*`**

1. Review `\docs\console\logs\` for system errors, warnings, and anomalies that might indicate operational issues. 
   a) If the directory does not exist, create it.
   b) After the new chat protocol is finished, recommend to the user to implement logging.
2. Check `\docs\bugs\` to identify **reported bugs, unresolved issues, and past debugging efforts**.  
3. Summarize findings in a **structured overview** that includes:  
   - The **project’s structure and key components**  
   - Any **discrepancies or inconsistencies** found  
   - **Potential problem areas** and **known issues**  
   - Recommendations for **next steps**  
4. Develop a **context document** summarizing all findings. The document should be created in `\docs\context\[ai_context][date][hh:mm:ss]` **use system time via cmd echo %DATE% %TIME%** and must include:  
   - The date and time of the investigation  
   - A summary of key observations  
   - Any inconsistencies or issues detected  
   - Areas requiring further investigation
   - Entry points for the application
5. Ensure all old context documents are in .gitignore except the most recent five.
6. Delete the new_chat_protol_checklist once complete.
7. Update the README.md if you have found anything new.
8. Provide a summary of your understanding of the software and entry points, and request the plan moving forward.
