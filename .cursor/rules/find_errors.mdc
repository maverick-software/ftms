**IMPORTANT** *DO NOT KEYBOARD INTERRUPT THE SOFTWARE*

1. run the program from it's gui entry point, and listen for errors. 

2. Do not interrupt the user when they are using the platform, just wait for them to close the application, and then view the console logs. You can find them in \docs\console\ directory. They are timestamped, so you can find the one closest to the system time.

3. You can get the data from the computer system via the command uding the command: echo %DATE% %TIME%** *for AI Agents, it is cmd /c echo %DATE% %TIME%*

4. When you find errors, call the documentation.mdc and best_practices.mdc. After documenting the erros, use the problem_solving.mdc and big_picture_protocol.mdc to come up with a feasible plan to resolve the errors.
