Knowledge Base Documentation Template for Completed Fixes and Features

**Location** `\docs\knowledge_base\[fix_feature]`

This document serves as a structured template for developers to document any fixes or features they have implemented. It ensures that all solutions are well-documented for future reference, making it easier for teams to understand, troubleshoot, and improve upon past work.

Now that you have completed this most recent task gather and compile all of your notes into a knowledge base document that can be used for study later. These should include:

Title of the Fix/Feature:
